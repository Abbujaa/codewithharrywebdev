//how does a webpage work
3 things
client
server
browser

when we go on a webpage we are on the client page and we send request to browser and browser send
 request to server and then server recommunicates the request i.e answer to the request to browser 
 and browser give result to client 

 client are us
 browser is chrome
 server is google.com/youtube.com 

The Backend is the server side of the website.
It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side works fine.
It is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.
//

for website we want 
html-skeleton
 css - styling - beauty
 javascript - inter action - brain
